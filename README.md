This is a demo of a **mini RESTful API** that interacts with a database using the **Flask** library.  

Both the **web server** and the **database** are deployed internally on **Render**.  

All detailed information about the functionality and usage of the API can be found on the homepage.

Please use API testing tools such as **Postman** to experiment with the API.
